Optimize sales plan by analyzing invoices and financial reports 
In order to better understand the purchasing behavior of the 7th floor store's customers, we wanted to carry out an in-depth analysis of its sales.
To do so, we managed to obtain nearly 700 sales receipts corresponding to the first 7 days of the month of November (from the 1st to the 7th of November 2021) as well as the first day of the Christmas period of the year 2020 (corresponding to the 22nd of December 2020).
Adding the tickets for the Christmas period seemed to us to be relevant because the number of sales was higher than in normal times. 
We also removed all the receipts for which the customers had bought only one product since this could not allow us to identify the products that were often bought together
